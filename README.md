# DAC81408_lib
A basic BETA library for TI's DAC81408 precision DAC and the associated DAC81404EVM

**See `main.cpp` for an working example. Compile with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.**

**Platforms:**
I tested the code with Teensy 3.x & 4.x. The code should work for other platforms as well. Please report if something is amiss.

**Limitations:**
1. BETA versions - some bugs may exist. Please report if you encounter one. 
2. LDAC pin is not handled by the library.

**TODO:**
1. Code cleanup
2. Add more examples and follow standard Arduino library format
